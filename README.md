In this project, I explored a computer vision library meant to help the annotation of body-parts of some frames and interpolation to further data. This was used to generate a sequence of points of my finger tracing out letters. Then, after identifying the start and end frames of each letters in the video, we attempted to train a Neural Network using the emnist dataset to label the letters I drew in the air.
